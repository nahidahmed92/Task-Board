# Challenge 05

## Third-Party APIs: Task Board

In this challenge I have created a task board which detects due date and color codes appropriately. Tasks can be dragged and moved to different progress states. Once in Done color code will go away and be plain. If dragged back it will color code again. Deleting a task will remove from localStorage.
